# Description

For this task I used [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and the [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture. The build process is handled by [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

# Get it running

```
git clone https://github.com/alesma/rbt.git
cd rbt 
npm install # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
npm run build # Fires webpack and http-server
```
